# Limbo and The Art of Computer Programming

This repo contains implementation of algorithms from 
Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming 
implemented in the Limbo programming language.

The initial focus is on backtracking and the XCC
eXact Cover with Covers from fasicle 5.

I'm using the 9ferno fork of inferno-os with
64bit word size running on amd64 Linux.

See my 9ferno amd64 branch.
But the limbo code should compile and run on any inferno.
